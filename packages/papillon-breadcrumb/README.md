## Documentation

Breadcrumbs are used to show taxonomical context on pages that are many levels deep in a siteâ€™s hierarchy. Breadcrumbs show and link to parent, grandparent, and sometimes great-grandparent pages. Breadcrumbs are most appropriate on pages that:

- Are many levels deep on a site
- Do not have a section-level navigation
- May need the ability to quickly go back to the previous (parent) page

### Default

```javascript
const items = [
  { href: '/business', text: 'Business' },
  { href: '/business/customer', text: 'Customers' },
  { href: '', text: 'MailChimp' },
];
```

```html
  <Breadcrumb items={items} selectedIndex={2} />
```
